@article{Wang2020,
abstract = {Model Predictive Static Programming (MPSP) has been always used under the assumption of continuous or impulsive control, but never in low-thrust transfers featuring bang-off-bang control. Following the observation that the sensitivity matrix (SM) is discontinuous across the switching time, this work introduces a two-loop MPSP guidance scheme using fuel-optimal trajectories as nominal solutions. In our method, the equations of motion are augmented by the mass costate equation, while the velocity costate is the MPSP control, expressed by a weighted sum of Fourier basis functions. The SM is computed at the switching time by using calculus of variations. Both the MPSP control and the initial mass costate are updated in an inner loop using Newton's method, and continuation is employed in an outer loop to face large perturbations. A sample interplanetary CubeSat mission to an asteroid is used as study case to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method developed.},

@article{Wu2009,
abstract = {A generalized formulation of quarter-wave symmetrical selective harmonic elimination (SHE) problems according to the rising and falling edges of the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveforms for multilevel inverters is proposed. The SHE modulation scheme features a broad solution space and can eliminate a large number of low-order harmonics. An effective method for obtaining initial values of switching angles is proposed.Thismethod is based on rules of equal area and superposition of center of gravity (cg) of the PWM section with the sine reference signal. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed SHE method, a five-level voltage source inverter with elimination of 11 low-order harmonics is investigated. The SHE-PWM equations that can eliminate harmonics from 5th to 35th with modulation index M varying from 0 to 1.15 are formulated, and solutions are presented. Simulations and experiments based on two sets of solutions are carried out. It is demonstrated that the experimental results agree well with simulated ones, which proves the validity and practicability of the new method proposed. {\textcopyright} 2009, IEEE.

@article{Zuazua2011,
abstract = {We analyze the problem of switching controls for control systems endowed with different actuators. The goal is to control the dynamics of the system by switching from an actuator to another in a systematic way so that, at each instant of time, only one actuator is active. We first address a finite-dimensional model and show that, under suitable rank conditions, switching control strategies exist and can be built in a systematic way. To do this we introduce a new variational principle building a new functional based on the adjoint system whose minimizers yield the switching controls. When the above rank condition fails, the same variational strategy applies but the controls obtained this way fail to be of switching form since they may be, for some instants of time, convex combinations of both controllers. We then address the same issue for the 1-d heat equation endowed with two pointwise controls. We show that, due to the time analyticity of solutions, under suitable conditions on the location of the controllers, switching control strategies exist. We also show that the controls we obtain are optimal in the sense that, for instance, for two scalar valued controls, they are of minimal L2 (0, T; ℝ2)-norm, the space ℝ2 being endowed with the l1-norm. We also discuss some possible extensions to multi-dimensional heat equations which require a preliminary analysis of generic properties of the spectrum that, as far as we know, are not yet well understood. {\textcopyright} European Mathematical Society 2011.},
