@article{Wang2020,
abstract = {Model Predictive Static Programming (MPSP) has been always used under the assumption of continuous or impulsive control, but never in low-thrust transfers featuring bang-off-bang control. Following the observation that the sensitivity matrix (SM) is discontinuous across the switching time, this work introduces a two-loop MPSP guidance scheme using fuel-optimal trajectories as nominal solutions. In our method, the equations of motion are augmented by the mass costate equation, while the velocity costate is the MPSP control, expressed by a weighted sum of Fourier basis functions. The SM is computed at the switching time by using calculus of variations. Both the MPSP control and the initial mass costate are updated in an inner loop using Newton's method, and continuation is employed in an outer loop to face large perturbations. A sample interplanetary CubeSat mission to an asteroid is used as study case to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method developed.},

@article{Wu2009,
abstract = {A generalized formulation of quarter-wave symmetrical selective harmonic elimination (SHE) problems according to the rising and falling edges of the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveforms for multilevel inverters is proposed. The SHE modulation scheme features a broad solution space and can eliminate a large number of low-order harmonics. An effective method for obtaining initial values of switching angles is proposed.Thismethod is based on rules of equal area and superposition of center of gravity (cg) of the PWM section with the sine reference signal. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed SHE method, a five-level voltage source inverter with elimination of 11 low-order harmonics is investigated. The SHE-PWM equations that can eliminate harmonics from 5th to 35th with modulation index M varying from 0 to 1.15 are formulated, and solutions are presented. Simulations and experiments based on two sets of solutions are carried out. It is demonstrated that the experimental results agree well with simulated ones, which proves the validity and practicability of the new method proposed. {\textcopyright} 2009, IEEE.
