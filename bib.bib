abstract = {The problem of selective harmonic elimination pulse-width modulation (SHE-PWM) exhibits multiple sets of solutions. While these sets provide different solutions to the same problem, their harmonic performance varies greatly. Typical formulations to the problem have so far considered a quarter-wave symmetrically defined waveform in order to simplify the process of finding the required solutions, with great expense to the available solution space. In this paper, the three-phase half-wave symmetrically defined bipolar harmonic elimination is considered and analyzed in detail. The generalized formulation is also introduced and the multiple sets of solutions that exist are reported. An evaluation of the multiple sets with regard to the amplitude of the first significant harmonic and harmonic distortion factor is also performed. Selected simulation and experimental results are provided in order to verify the theoretical considerations. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The paper presents an analytical approach to find switching angles for an optimal PWM signal. The solution is in closed form that eliminates the need for numerical solution to find the transition angles. The disadvantage in iterative computation is overhead in computational effort as it requires a PC with expensive software and solution time can be a problem in real-time operation. Such an approach is prohibitive in low cost applications. In the proposed work, the equations can be programmed into a microcontroller and the PWM is generated by the micro with a digital control of the fundamental. The approach has been illustrated for three switching angles to avoid complexity although it is applicable to more transition angles. The paper also focuses on three phase systems where it is not necessary to eliminate the triplen harmonics. The analysis provides an insight for multiple solutions that exist in triplen system. The modulation depth can be altered digitally and this feature makes the approach attractive for MPPT integrated inverter. Simulation and microcontroller implementation results are included.},

abstract = {Pulse-width modulation (PWM) based on the elimination of low-order harmonics necessitates solving systems of nonlinear equations. Conventional implementations of this technique based on storing off-line calculated solutions have the common problem that the system flexibility is very limited, especially for applications that require both amplitude and frequency control. A new implementation scheme based on real-time solution of nonlinear harmonic elimination equations using a digital signal processor DSP56001 is reported in this paper. With this digital signal processor (DSP), optimal pulse patterns having 15 switching angles in each quarter fundamental period can be determined within 2.15 ms.

@article{Chudnovsky1999,
abstract = {The mathematical underpinning of the pulse width modulation (PWM) technique lies in the attempt to represent 'accurately' harmonic waveforms using only square forms of a fixed height. The accuracy can be measured using many norms, but the quality of the approximation of the analog signal (a harmonic form) by a digital one (simple pulses of a fixed high voltage level) requires of the elimination of high order harmonics in the error term. The most important practical problem is in 'accurate' reproduction of sine-wave using the same number of pulses as the number of high harmonics eliminated. We describe in this paper a complete solution of the PWM problem using Pade approximations, orthogonal polynomials, and solitons. The main result of the paper is the characterization of discrete pulses answering the general PWM problem in terms of the manifold of all rational solutions to Korteweg-de Vries equations.},

@article{Janabi2020,
abstract = {This article presents a novel approach to significantly reducing the mathematical complexity associated with the selective harmonic elimination (SHE), which allows for the real-time implementation of SHE with a reasonable utilization of the computational power of the digital controller. First, the transcendental equations of the optimization problem are converted to a set of algebraic equations using Chebyshev polynomials. Second, the set of algebraic equations is reduced to a single univalent polynomial using generalized Newton's identities. The roots of the polynomial hold a unique solution to the optimization problem. We show that the roots of the univalent polynomial can be solved in real time by direct substitution with no initial guess or iteration. The proposed method is a generalization of a Chudnovsky algorithm; it allows the modulation of the selected harmonics rather than eliminating them. Furthermore, the technique by which the roots of the polynomial are obtained enables one to implement the algorithm in real time with determinate execution time. This article lays the groundwork for presenting the generalized algorithm through a two-level voltage-source inverter drive. More application will follow in the near future.},

The technique for the half-bridge inverter is optimized subject to the constraint of switching frequency of the SCR's, using the concepts of modern control theory. Variable-frequency variable-voltage sinusoidal output in three-phase inverters is possible by employing the techniques developed.

This paper presents the most important topologies like diode-clamped inverter (neutral-point clamped), capacitor-clamped (flying capacitor), and cascaded multicell with separate dc sources. Emerging topologies like asymmetric hybrid cells and soft-switched multilevel inverters are also discussed. This paper also presents the most relevant control and modulation methods developed for this family of converters: multilevel sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation, multilevel selective harmonic elimination, and space-vector modulation. Special attention is dedicated to the latest and more relevant applications of these converters such as laminators, conveyor belts, and unified power-flow controllers. The need of an active front end at the input side for those inverters supplying regenerative loads is also discussed, and the circuit topology options are also presented. Finally, the peripherally developing areas such as high-voltage high-power devices and optical sensors and other opportunities for future development are addressed.},

@article{Yang2015,
abstract = {An algebraic method is proposed for selective harmonic elimination PWM (SHEPWM). By computing its Groebner bases under the pure lexicographic monomial order, the nonlinear high-order SHE equations are converted to an equivalent triangular form, and then a recursive algorithm is used to solve the triangular equations one by one. Based on the proposed method, a user-friendly software package has been developed and some computation results are given. Unlike the commonly used numerical and intelligent methods, this method does not need to choose the initial values and can find all the solutions. Also, this method can give a definite answer to the question of whether the SHE equations have solutions or not, and the accuracy of the solved switching angles are much higher than that of the reference method. Compared with the existing algebraic methods, such as the resultant elimination method, the calculation efficiency is improved. Experimental verification is also shown in this paper.},

@article{Yang2017,
abstract = {For multilevel converters, as their selective harmonic elimination (SHE) equations are highly related to the switching patterns, it is almost impossible to give a complete study for all the switching patterns under the traditional SHE framework. In this paper, a unified SHE approach is proposed, in which the various SHE equations for different switching patterns are merged into one group of unified SHE equations and the inequality constraints on the switching angles are eliminated at all. This unified SHE equations can be solved by any methods, which have been used in solving the traditional SHE problems. By using the theory of Groebner bases and symmetric polynomials, all the possible switching patterns and the corresponding switching angles can be solved simultaneously. The study on the case for four switching angles discovers some unusual switching patterns that have the lowest total harmonic distortion for low-modulation indices. Also, the case for nine switching angles with modulation index m= 0.72 is studied; in total, there exist 43 groups of switching angles, which belong to 33 different switching patterns. Experiments on a 13-level cascaded-H bridge converter verify the correctness of this unified multilevel SHE approach.},
