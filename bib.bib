abstract = {Model Predictive Static Programming (MPSP) has been always used under the assumption of continuous or impulsive control, but never in low-thrust transfers featuring bang-off-bang control. Following the observation that the sensitivity matrix (SM) is discontinuous across the switching time, this work introduces a two-loop MPSP guidance scheme using fuel-optimal trajectories as nominal solutions. In our method, the equations of motion are augmented by the mass costate equation, while the velocity costate is the MPSP control, expressed by a weighted sum of Fourier basis functions. The SM is computed at the switching time by using calculus of variations. Both the MPSP control and the initial mass costate are updated in an inner loop using Newton's method, and continuation is employed in an outer loop to face large perturbations. A sample interplanetary CubeSat mission to an asteroid is used as study case to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method developed.},

abstract = {A generalized formulation of quarter-wave symmetrical selective harmonic elimination (SHE) problems according to the rising and falling edges of the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveforms for multilevel inverters is proposed. The SHE modulation scheme features a broad solution space and can eliminate a large number of low-order harmonics. An effective method for obtaining initial values of switching angles is proposed.Thismethod is based on rules of equal area and superposition of center of gravity (cg) of the PWM section with the sine reference signal. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed SHE method, a five-level voltage source inverter with elimination of 11 low-order harmonics is investigated. The SHE-PWM equations that can eliminate harmonics from 5th to 35th with modulation index M varying from 0 to 1.15 are formulated, and solutions are presented. Simulations and experiments based on two sets of solutions are carried out. It is demonstrated that the experimental results agree well with simulated ones, which proves the validity and practicability of the new method proposed. {\textcopyright} 2009, IEEE.

@article{Zuazua2011,
abstract = {We analyze the problem of switching controls for control systems endowed with different actuators. The goal is to control the dynamics of the system by switching from an actuator to another in a systematic way so that, at each instant of time, only one actuator is active. We first address a finite-dimensional model and show that, under suitable rank conditions, switching control strategies exist and can be built in a systematic way. To do this we introduce a new variational principle building a new functional based on the adjoint system whose minimizers yield the switching controls. When the above rank condition fails, the same variational strategy applies but the controls obtained this way fail to be of switching form since they may be, for some instants of time, convex combinations of both controllers. We then address the same issue for the 1-d heat equation endowed with two pointwise controls. We show that, due to the time analyticity of solutions, under suitable conditions on the location of the controllers, switching control strategies exist. We also show that the controls we obtain are optimal in the sense that, for instance, for two scalar valued controls, they are of minimal L2 (0, T; ℝ2)-norm, the space ℝ2 being endowed with the l1-norm. We also discuss some possible extensions to multi-dimensional heat equations which require a preliminary analysis of generic properties of the spectrum that, as far as we know, are not yet well understood. {\textcopyright} European Mathematical Society 2011.},

However, challenges such as the task of finding all the multiple sets of solutions of the switching angles for a given problem may be difficult to deal with. In this paper, a direct minimization of the nonlinear transcendental trigonometric Fourier functions in combination with a random search is discussed. The unipolar (three-level) waveform is used to illustrate the proposed method confirming its ability to find multiple sets of solutions, including a case where 51 angles are sought for single- and three-phase applications. A simple harmonic distortion factor is studied for each set of solutions to assess their performance against the noneliminated harmonics. The results presented both at theoretical and experimental level are in close agreement and confirm the robustness of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

This formulation offers more degrees of freedom for specifying the cost function without any physical changes to the converter circuit, as compared to conventional stepped waveform technique, and hence the performance of the converter is greatly enhanced. The paper utilizes the merits of the hybrid real coded genetic algorithm (HRCGA) in finding the optimal solution to the nonlinear equation system with fast and guaranteed convergence. It is confirmed that multiple independent sets of solutions exist. Different operating points for both five- and seven-level converters including single- and three-phase patterns are documented.

@article{Xu2002,
abstract = {This paper provides a viable general approach to switched systems optimal control. Such optimal control problems require the solutions of not only optimal continuous inputs but also optimal switching sequences. Many practical problems only involve optimization where the number of switchings and the sequence of active subsystems are given. This is stage 1 of the two stage optimization methodology proposed by the authors in previous papers. In order to solve stage 1 problems, the derivatives of the optimal cost with respect to the switching instants need to be known. In (Xu and Antsaklis, 2001), we proposed an approach for solving a special class of such problems, namely, general switched linear quadratic problems. In this paper, the idea of (Xu and Antsaklis, 2001) is extended to general switched systems optimal control problems and an approach is proposed for solving them. The approach first transcribes a stage 1 problem into an equivalent problem parameterized by the switching instants and then the values of the derivatives are obtained based on the solution of a two point boundary value differential algebraic equation formed by the state, costate, stationarity equations, the boundary and continuity conditions and their differentiations. Examples are shown to illustrate the results in the paper.},

abstract = {This contribution addresses the problem of discrete time receding horizon quadratic control for plants whose input is restricted to belong to a finite set. We also study the dynamics of the resulting closed-loop system. Based upon the geometry of the underlying quadratic programme, a finitely parametrized expression for the control law is derived, which makes use of vector quantizers. Alternatively, the control law can be formulated by means of a polyhedral partition of the state space, which is closely connected with the partition induced when considering saturation-like constraints. Exact analytic expressions for the partition can be developed, therefore avoiding the need for on-line optimization. The closed-loop system, comprising controller and plant, exhibits highly nonlinear dynamics, due to the finite set restriction. Asymptotic stability only holds for very special cases. In general, this notion is too strong. Nevertheless, ultimate boundedness of state trajectories is often achieved. Tools for determining positively invariant sets, hence ensuring ultimate boundedness, are presented. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2004 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},
