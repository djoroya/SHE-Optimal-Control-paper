\section{Conclusiones}\label{Section6}


We presented the SHE problem from the point of view of control theory. This methodology allows obtaining a $10^{-4}-10^{-5}$ precision in the distance to the target vector. Nevertheless, comparing with methodologies where the commutation number is fixed a priori, our approximation is computationally more expensive. Notwithstanding that, the optimal control provides solutions in the entire range of the modulation index, although the number of solutions or their locations change dramatically.

This methodology for the SHE problem connects control theory with harmonic elimination. In this way, the SHE problem can be solved through classical tools.
